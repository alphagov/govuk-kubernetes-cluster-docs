# Create a new environment

You can create a new test, staging, integration or production environment on the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform.

You create a new environment to, for example, work on new functionality or resources for the platform.

To create a new environment, you must:

- complete the prerequisites
- create secrets for the new environment
- create a new environment
- deploy the Terraform modules and delete the configmap
- create the Signon API token
- check the environment is working

## Complete the prerequisites

Before creating a new environment, you must:

- [set up the tools needed to use the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform](/get-started/set-up-tools/#set-up-tools-to-use-the-gov-uk-kubernetes-platform)
- [request a new AWS account](https://gds-request-an-aws-account.cloudapps.digital/)
- [install the AWS-CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- [install the `gds-cli`](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#4-install-gds-command-line-tools), which you should have done already as part of [getting started on GOV.UK](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html)

## Create secrets for the new environment

The [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) stores and manages GOV.UK Kubernetes platform [secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

You must create secrets for the new environment before creating the environment itself. You do this by copying an existing environment's secrets in the AWS Secrets Manager.

To copy the secrets, [run the `copy_sm_secrets.py` transfer script](https://gist.github.com/theseanything/1bb8add0077d3a2f5d979c12c6b9f140) in your command line.

When running this script, specify the following AWS-CLI profile names:

- `--src-profile`, that is the existing environment to copy the secrets from
- `--dst-profile`, that is the new environment to copy the secrets to

You can change the copied secrets for the new environment using the AWS console.

1. [Sign in to the AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) for the new environment.
1. Search for and select the __Secrets Manager__.
1. Make sure you are in the [`eu-west-2` region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html).
1. Select the secret that you want to change.
1. Change the secret, then select __Save__.

## Create a new environment

1. Run `export ENV=<ENVIRONMENT>` in the command line to define the type of environment you are creating.

    `<ENVIRONMENT>` can be `test`, `staging`, `integration` or `production`.

1. Create the Terraform state file and store it in an S3 bucket in your new AWS account:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-${ENV?}-admin -- terraform init -backend-config=${ENV?}.backend -reconfigure -upgrade
    ```

1. Update your AWS account to match the Terraform state file and create the new environment:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-${ENV?}-admin -- terraform apply -var-file ../variables/common.tfvars -var-file ../variables/${ENV?}/common.tfvars
    ```

## Deploy the Terraform modules and delete the configmap

Deploy the root Terraform modules in the following order.

### 1. Deploy the ecr module

The [AWS elastic container registry (ECR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html) stores [container images](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/) for the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform.

The [`ecr` module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/deployments/ecr) creates the ECR for the new environment.

1. In the command line, go to the `govuk-infrastructure/terraform/deployments/ecr/` folder on your local machine.

1. Run the following to deploy the `ecr` module:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform init -backend-config <ENVIRONMENT>.backend -reconfigure -upgrade

    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform apply -var-file ../variables/<ENVIRONMENT>/ecr.tfvars
    ```
    `<ENVIRONMENT>` is the environment type you defined in the earlier step.

If you are creating an integration or staging environment, you must [contact the GOV.UK replatforming team on Slack](https://gds.slack.com/archives/C013F737737) to discuss the impact of deploying the `ecr` module.

### 2. Deploy the cluster-infrastructure module

The [`cluster-infrastructure` module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/deployments/cluster-infrastructure) creates the AWS resources for the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform [Elastic Kubernetes Service(EKS) cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/).

1. In the command line, go to `govuk-infrastructure/terraform/deployments/cluster-infrastructure/` on your local machine.

1. Run the following to create the AWS resources for the EKS cluster:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform init -backend-config <ENVIRONMENT>.backend -reconfigure -upgrade

    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform apply
    ```
    `<ENVIRONMENT>` is the environment type you defined in the earlier step.

### 3. Delete the aws-auth configmap

Creating the AWS resources for the EKS cluster also creates a default `aws-auth` configmap.

This configmap does not work with the GOV.UK Kubernetes configuration. You must delete the configmap for the new environment to work.

Run the following to delete the `aws-auth` configmap:

```
gds aws govuk-${ENV?}-admin -- aws eks update-kubeconfig --name govuk && kubectl -n kube-system delete cm aws-auth
```

### 4. Deploy the govuk-publishing-infrastructure module

The [`govuk-publishing-infrastructure` module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/deployments/govuk-publishing-infrastructure) creates and manages AWS resources for the GOV.UK apps where we are not yet able to manage those resources using Kubernetes.

1. In the command line, go to `govuk-infrastructure/terraform/deployments/govuk-publishing-infrastructure/` on your local machine.

1. Run the following to deploy the `govuk-publishing-infrastructure` module:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform init -backend-config <ENVIRONMENT>.backend -reconfigure -upgrade

    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform apply
    ```
    `<ENVIRONMENT>` is the environment type you defined in the earlier step.

### 5. Deploy the cluster-services module

The [`cluster-services` module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/deployments/cluster-services) deploys the [services that enable GOV.UK](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/deployments/cluster-services) into the cluster.

1. In the command line, go to `govuk-infrastructure/terraform/deployments/cluster-services/` on your local machine.

1. Run the following to deploy the `cluster-services` module:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform init -backend-config <ENVIRONMENT>.backend -reconfigure -upgrade

    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform apply
    ```
    `<ENVIRONMENT>` is the environment type you defined in the earlier step.

## Create the Signon API token

[Signon](https://github.com/alphagov/signon) is an OAuth2-based single sign-on provider for GDS services.

Run the following to create the [Signon API token](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/blob/main/docs/signon-secrets.md) as a Kubernetes secret:

```
kubectl -n apps create secret generic signon-auth-token --from-literal=token=$(openssl rand -base64 40)
```

This allows Signon-resources to create or export tokens from Signon.

## Check the environment is working

You should now have successfully created a new environment on the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform.

To check the environment is working, go to the new environment URL endpoint at `â€œhttps://www.eks.<ENVIRONMENT>.govuk.digital`. For example, the endpoint for a new production environment is `https://www.eks.production.govuk.digital`.

You must be in the office or on the VPN to access this endpoint.

If the environment URL endpoint is not behaving as expected or shows an error, [contact the GOV.UK replatforming team on Slack](https://gds.slack.com/archives/C013F737737).

## Supporting information

When you create the new environment, the process will also create an instance of the [Kubescape tool](https://github.com/armosec/kubescape) to track vulnerabilities and other metrics.

See the [Kubescape user hub](https://hub.armosec.io/docs/welcome-to-kubescape-user-hub) for more information.

See also the [Kubernetes conceptual overview documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) for more information on Kubernetes overall.
