# Testing and releasing applications

Continious Integration is run in GitHub Actions workflow called 'CI'. This is run for pull requests and commits on the main branch. For Ruby application we use a re-usable worflow in the govuk-infrastructure repository. Where we define which backing services are required to run CI.

This run in conjuction to CI Jenkins, and neither effect each other. Currently Jenkins is running end to end tests, however they are being removed as part of RFC-XXX and have not been migrated to the GitHub Actions.  

When CI has been completed on a commit to main, this will trigger a automatic deployment to integration.

CI consists of linting, security checks, and running tests.
