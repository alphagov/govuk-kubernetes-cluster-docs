# Manage state in your app

## Troubleshooting

### Argo Application sync stuck "waiting for completion of hook"

An Argo Application may appear to be stuck syncing forever whilst waiting for the completion of a hook from a Job that not running. In this situation you may need to cancel the sync operation. You can do this from the Argo UI with following steps:

1. Choose the Application tile from the list of Applications
1. Click "Sync Status". A modal pane should slide in from the right of the screen.
1. Click "Terminate" from the modal to cancel the sync operation
1. Re-sync the application by clicking "Sync"

This should re-initiate the sync event and recreate the job needed to complete the sync.
