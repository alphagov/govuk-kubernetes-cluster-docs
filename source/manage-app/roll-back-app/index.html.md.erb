# Roll back your app

If you've deployed your app, and it is serving errors to users, you should roll back your app to an older version.

You can roll back your app by:

- replacing the release commit SHA
- manually deploying an older release - this only works in the integration environment

## Replacing the release commit SHA

1. Go to your app's repo.

1. Go to __Releases__ and then __Tags__, and select the abbreviated commit simple hashing algorithm (SHA), for example `bc0b0b0`.

    You can only roll back to previous commits that are on the main branch and relate to a release tag.

1. In the commit, copy the full SHA, for example `bc0b0b0c980f867b293cd40157c6da3a29186680`.

1. Go to the [`image-tags` folder in the `govuk-helm-charts` repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/argocd-apps/image-tags).

1. Select the environment you want to roll back your app in. Mostly this will be `production`. However, if you want to diagnose the error before rolling back the app in production, you can select `staging` instead.

1. Select the app you want to roll back, and replace the commit SHA in the file with the copied commit SHA you want to roll back to.

1. Create a pull request and merge the change into the main branch.

Once you have merged your pull request, [Argo CD automatically deploys the older version of the app to production](/manage-app/access-ci-cd/#deploying-a-release-of-a-gov-uk-app).

## Manually deploying an older version of the app

This rollback method only works for the integration environment.

1. Go to your app's repo and select __Releases__.

1. Find the release number for the version of the app you want to roll back to.

1. Go to __Actions__ and select __Workflows__ > __Deploy__.

1. Select _Run workflow__ and enter the release number that you want to roll back to.

1. Select _Run workflow__ to manually deploy the older version of the app.

Argo CD will then:

- automatically build the image for the older version of the app
- deploy that version of the app
