# Roll back your app

you've deployed an app, and you want to revert to an older version of the app because

it's a bad release, with errors to users

2 ways

1 method is to manually deploy an odler version of the app - only works for integration env deployment

go to the github repo for your app

go to releases (rhs)

find the release number for the older version you want to roll back to

make note of the tag number

select actions

select deploy under workflows

select run workflow to manually deploy a commit of the older version of the app

enter the release tag you want to manually deploy

then select run workflow

manually running will auto build the image for the older release and deploy it

2nd way

if github actions isnt working

go to app repo

go to release tags, and select the abbreviate commit hash of the older version

copy the full commit SHA on the right hand side at the top

got to https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts

charts > argocdapps > image tags - https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/argocd-apps/image-tags

select environemnt you want to roll back, most of the time would be production, however you can roll back to say staging if you want to diagnose the issue before deploying the oloder version to production

find the app you want to roll back

replace the commit hash in the file with the commit hash you want to roll back to

create a PR and merge that change into main

once that is merged in, argocd auto deploys, link to relevant docs

you can only roll back to previous commits on the main branch

you can only roll back to commits that relate to a release number / tag, not commits that are inbetween releases
