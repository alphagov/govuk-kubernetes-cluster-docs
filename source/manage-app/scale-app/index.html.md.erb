# Scale your app

If user demand on your app increases, you must increase the resources available to your app, also known as scaling your app.

## Scaling your app

To scale an app, change your app's `values.yaml` file in the [`charts` folder in the `govuk-helm-charts` repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/), and then commit that change.

When you merge the pull request, the changed file will be [automatically built and deployed by the CD pipeline](https://govuk-k8s-user-docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manage-app/access-ci-cd/#deploying-a-release-of-a-gov-uk-app).

[Check what you can scale](#what-you-can-scale) to know what values to change and why.

You should be aware of how your app interacts with other apps, and what effect scaling your app would have on the other apps.

For example, if you greatly increase your frontend app's number of instances or pods, you may need to increase the number of instances of any backend apps that support your frontend as well.

## Scaling platform resources

If you increase the resources available to your app, this will increase the load on the virtual machines (VMs) that the platform runs on.

You should be aware of this increased load on the platform, and look out for any [Argo CD deployment notifications or alerts](https://argocd-notifications.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

You can [email the GOV.UK Replatforming team](mailto:govuk-replatforming-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to discuss how scaling your app's resources affects the platform, and whether you need to scale the platform resources as well.

## What you can scale

You can scale the following replicas:

- `replicaCount`, that is the number of running instances or pods of your app
- `workerReplicaCount`, that is SOMETHING

You can also scale the following resources:

- number of VM CPU cores
- amount of VM memory
- number of requests that can be sent to the VM CPU cores
- amount of VM memory that can be allocated to handling requests

You can scale these resources for the following resource categories:

- `appResources`, that is the resources that your app uses
- `workerResources`, that is the reosurces that your worker nodes use
- `jobResources`, that is the resources that your jobs use
- `nginxResources`, that is the resources that the NGINX load balancer uses

Most of the time, you should scale the `appResources`.
