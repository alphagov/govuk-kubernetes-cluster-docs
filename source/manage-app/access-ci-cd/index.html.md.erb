# How apps are deployed

When you push an app to the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform, the Continuous Implementation / Continuous Deployment (CI / CD) process automatically deploys the app on the platform by:

- building and pushing an app's Docker image to the GOV.UK AWS elastic container repository (ECR)
- deploying the app container in GOV.UK AWS ECR

If the app does not deploy successfully, you can access the CI and CD logs to see what went wrong.

## Build and push an app's Docker image to GOV.UK AWS ECR

GOV.UK uses the GitHub Actions CI process to build and push an app's Docker image to the private GOV.UK production AWS elastic container repository (ECR).

This CI process is run automatically when a user:

- creates a new branch in GitHub for an app
- adds new commits to that branch
- merges the branch into the main branch

The exact steps in the CI process is specific to each app. This process is defined in the app's GitHub Actions workflow CI yaml file. This file is in the app's repository at `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.

You can view the status of the GitHub Actions CI process at `https://github.com/alphagov/<application repo>/actions`. The workflow is called __Build and publish to ECR__.

An example CI process would running tests on the app, linting, and building artifacts for libraries released to other platforms.

When a user merges the branch into the main branch on GitHub, GitHub Actions tags that merge commit with a release tag.

Release tags are sequential, and the release numbers are incremented with every merge into the main branch. An example release tag is `release_3832.`

When the merge is complete, GitHub Actions builds and publishes the app Docker image, and pushes that image to AWS ECR. GitHub Actions also tags the image with the same release number.

## Deploy the app container in AWS ECR

[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a continuous deployment (CD) tool for Kubernetes. GOV.UK uses Argo CD to run its CD process for the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform.

Once the app Docker image is in AWS ECR, an automatic process within AWS ECR detects this new image from the new release tag and builds the app container from the image.

This process then updates the image tag within the [GOV.UK Helm chart value file for the integration environment](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/argocd-apps/values-integration.yaml) by writing a new commit to the GOV.UK Helm chart repo.

Argo CD will then detect the difference between the app image tags in the Helm chart repo and the Kubernetes integration environment.

Argo CD deploys the new image tag to Kubernetes, and updates the app running in the Kubernetes integration environment to use the container with the latest image tag.

Once the app is updated to use the latest image tag, Argo CD runs smoke tests to check that the updated app is working as expected in the integration environment.

If the smoke tests pass successfully, Argo CD repeats this process for the staging environment, and then the production environment.

Join the [#govuk-deploy-alerts Slack channel](https://gds.slack.com/archives/C01EE7US9R6) to get a notification when an app is deployed and whether the deployment succeeded or failed.

If your app deployment failed, you should check the Argo CD logs to see why.

## Check the Argo CD logs

You must sign into Argo CD to view the Argo CD logs.

The environment you need to sign into depends on where the app deployment failed.

### Check the Argo CD integration environment

If your app deployment failed in integration, sign into the [Argo CD integration environment](https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/) using your GitHub account.

To sign into integration, your GitHub account must be part of the [GOV.UK team on alphagov](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/teams/gov-uk).

### Check the Argo CD staging environment

If your app deployment failed in integration, sign into the [Argo CD staging environment](https://argo.eks.staging.govuk.digital/) using your GitHub account.

To sign into staging, your GitHub account must be ??????.

### Check the Argo CD production environment

If your app deployment failed in production, sign into the [Argo CD production environment](https://argo.eks.production.govuk.digital/) using your GitHub account.

To sign into production, your GitHub account must be part of the [GOV.UK production team on alphagov](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/teams/gov-uk-production).

See the [documentation on getting production access](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/rules-for-getting-production-access.html) for more information.
