# GOV.UK Kubernetes platform user documentation

The GOV.UK Kubernetes platform is an AWS-hosted [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster, using Amazon's [Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services.

Kubernetes facilitates both [declarative configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/declarative-config/) and automation.

Kubernetes manages the entire lifecycle of containerised applications and provides mechanisms for:

- service discovery and load balancing
- persistent storage orchestration
- automated rollouts and rollbacks
- self-healing deployments
- secrets and config management

See the official [Kubernetes overview documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) for more details.

Use this technical documentation to find out how to:

- start using the platform
- manage your app on the platform
