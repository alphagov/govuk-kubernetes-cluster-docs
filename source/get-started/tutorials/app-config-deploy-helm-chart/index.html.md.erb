# App configuration and deployment using the govuk helm chart

This tutorial aims to guide you through the process of updating configuration in the govuk-helm-charts repo for the test app and seeing the deployment following the changes you made.

In a real world situation you might also make changes to the number of CPUs for the app, memory size etc.

1. App configuration update in GOVUK helm chart

Add your `ENV_MESSAGE_<your name>` environment variable value for the test app configuration in [govuk-helm-charts](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/argocd-apps/values-integration.yaml#L998) in a new branch.

2. Deploying the changes to the app

Create the pull request on your branch and post it for review on the #govuk-replatforming-class channel. After your PR has been approved for merging into the main branch, merge the PR in and look at the [argo CD apps workflow](https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/applications/argocd-apps?view=tree&resource=) as your change gets deployed.

3. See the changes in Argo

You should be able to see your changes in the manifest within Argo (https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/applications/argocd-apps?view=tree&resource=&node=argoproj.io%2FApplication%2Fcluster-services%2Fgovuk-replatform-test-app%2F0)

4. See your environment message in the test app

Navigate to https://govuk-replatform-test-app.eks.integration.govuk.digital/?status=200 to see the `ENV_MESSAGE` as part of the page output, you have now successfully deployed the change to the GOV.UK kubernetes integration cluster.

5. Tidy up your `ENV_MESSAGE`

Please remove your `ENV_MESSAGE` once you are happy that you have seen your changes in the test app manifest within Argo and on the test app website.
