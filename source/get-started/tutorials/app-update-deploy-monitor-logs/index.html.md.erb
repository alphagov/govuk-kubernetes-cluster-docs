# App update, deployment, monitoring and logs

This tutorial will take you through steps to make changes to the test app which will then get deployed to the cluster. Once deployed you should be able to see your changes in the logs and make requests to return specified status codes which should be visible in the grafana dashboard. 

1. App update in the test app

Add a new text file with a prefix of your name, e.g. jblogs-test.txt, to the [test app](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-replatform-test-app/tree/main/messages) `messages` directory on the `main` branch, this can be done via your chosen IDE or directly on github.

2. Notify other tutorial devs

Send a slack message to the #govuk-replatforming-class channel to let them know that you are planning to deploy changes to the test app as this will cause them to require a pull of the latest main branch.

3. Deploying the changes to the app

Commit your changes to the main branch to start the deployment process. 

You would normally create a PR before pushing changes to the main branch but as you will be just adding text files to a directory there should be little chance of anything breaking.

4. Seeing the app changes being deployed

You can monitor the app changes via [github actions](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-replatform-test-app/actions) which triggers a [job](https://argo-workflows.eks.integration.govuk.digital/workflows/apps?limit=500) to update the image tag stored in [govuk-helms-chart](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/argocd-apps/image-tags/integration/govuk-replatform-test-app) repo. 

This causes the [app in the cluster](https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/applications/argocd-apps?view=tree&resource=&node=argoproj.io%2FApplication%2Fcluster-services%2Fgovuk-replatform-test-app%2F0) to be out of sync with the image tag on the govuk-helms-chart so argo will attempt to redeploy the app to keep it in sync.

5. Seeing the app website working

To see the app website working you can visit the [test app](https://govuk-replatform-test-app.eks.integration.govuk.digital/?status=200).

6. See app metrics on the grafana dashboard

Change the status parameter in the test app url to a 5xx status in order to see the error appearing in the [grafana dashboard](https://grafana.eks.integration.govuk.digital/d/000000109/app-request-rates-errors-durations?orgId=1&refresh=10s&var-namespace=tutorials&var-app=govuk-replatform-test-app&var-quantile=All&var-error_status=All).

Be aware that if it is difficult to see your metrics in grafana because there are multiple users running the tutorial, it should be possible to view your metrics in [prometheus](https://prometheus.eks.integration.govuk.digital/graph?g0.expr=http_request_duration_seconds%7Bjob%3D%22apps%2Fgovuk-replatform-test-app%22%2C%20install_id%3D%221660837311%22%7D&g0.tab=0&g0.stacked=0&g0.show_exemplars=0&g0.range_input=1h) instead using a filter for your identifier.

7. View the messages in your text file in the logs

One of the outputs of the page will be an identifier which you can use to see the output of your deployment in the logs - 

```
...

Hello 1660815896! The time is 2022-09-08 15:00:00 +0000, you requested a 200 status response
```

Using the identifier - `1660815896` in this request -

`https://kibana.logit.io/s/42f4d2d5-e9ce-451f-8ffc-cdb25bd624f8/app/discover#/?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:now-4d,to:now))&_a=(columns:!(_source),filters:!(),index:'8ac115c0-aac1-11e8-88ea-0383c11b333a',interval:auto,query:(language:kuery,query:"1660815896"),sort:!())` 

Will bring up a page for logs relevant to your app deployment.

8. Tidy up your messages

Once you are happy that you have seen your requests in grafana and logs for your deployment in kibana please remove your messages.

## Maintenance

Do not merge changes to the base test app directly to the `main` branch. If you want to make changes to the test app please create a PR and send it to the `#replatforming` slack channel for review.
