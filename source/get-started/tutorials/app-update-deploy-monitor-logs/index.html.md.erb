# Deploy a new version of the example test app, check the deployment, monitor the app on grafana and view application logs

This tutorial will teach you how to deploy changes to an app and how to view application metrics and logs.

In this tutorial, you will make a change to the example test app to print your message in the application output and view the message in the application logs. Later, you will make HTTP requests to the example test app and simulate responses with different status codes and view those response metics in Grafana. 

1. Update the example test app with your message

- Clone the [example test app](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-replatform-test-app/tree/main/messages).
- Create a new branch to add your changes.
- Add a new text file with a prefix of your name, e.g. jblogs-test.txt, in the [test app](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-replatform-test-app/tree/main/messages) `messages` directory.

2. Deploy the app changes to the integration environment

Create a pull request (PR) and then merge your changes in to kick off the deployment process.

3. See that the app changes have started the deployment

You can check the ["Deploy" GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-replatform-test-app/actions) to see that the deployment has begun. This workflow builds a new container image with your application changes, and then triggers an [Argo workflow](https://argo-workflows.eks.integration.govuk.digital/workflows/apps?limit=500) to update the image tag stored in [govuk-helms-chart](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/argocd-apps/image-tags/integration/govuk-replatform-test-app) repository.  

This causes the [app in the cluster](https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/applications/argocd-apps?view=tree&resource=&node=argoproj.io%2FApplication%2Fcluster-services%2Fgovuk-replatform-test-app%2F0) to be out of sync with the image tag on the govuk-helms-chart so Argo will attempt to redeploy the app to keep it in sync.

4. Check your message on the example test app website

To see your message on the example test app website visit the [example test app](https://govuk-replatform-test-app.eks.integration.govuk.digital/?status=200).

5. View app metrics on the Grafana dashboard

Change the status parameter in the test app url to a 5xx status in order to see the error appearing in the [grafana dashboard](https://grafana.eks.integration.govuk.digital/d/000000109/app-request-rates-errors-durations?orgId=1&refresh=10s&var-namespace=tutorials&var-app=govuk-replatform-test-app&var-quantile=All&var-error_status=All).

6. View the messages in your text file in the logs

One of the outputs of the page will be an identifier which you can use to see the output of your deployment in the logs - 

```
...

Hello 1660815896! The time is 2022-09-08 15:00:00 +0000, you requested a 200 status response
```

Using the identifier - `1660815896` in this request -

`https://kibana.logit.io/s/42f4d2d5-e9ce-451f-8ffc-cdb25bd624f8/app/discover#/?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:now-4d,to:now))&_a=(columns:!(_source),filters:!(),index:'8ac115c0-aac1-11e8-88ea-0383c11b333a',interval:auto,query:(language:kuery,query:"1660815896"),sort:!())` 

Will bring up a page for logs relevant to your app deployment.

7. Tidy up your messages

Once you are happy that you have seen your requests in Grafana and logs for your deployment in Kibana please revert your PR to remove your messges.

## Maintenance

If you want to make changes to the test app please create a PR and send it to the `#replatforming` slack channel for review.
