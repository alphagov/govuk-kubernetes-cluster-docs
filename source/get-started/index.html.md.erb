# Get started

To start using the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform, you must:

- set up tools
- access the Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster
- access the Continuous Implementation / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines

Once you have done this, you can use the platform to familiarise yourself with how Kubernetes works.

Please note that the tutorials do not require any set up of the tools.
