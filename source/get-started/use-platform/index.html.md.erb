# Use the platform

## Interact with the cluster with `kubectl`

This acts as a quick reference to Kubectl, listing some of the most common operations.

The examples here only address the most basic approach to these operations. For more options, please refer to the command-line help of `kubectl` subcommands, which you can access like this:

```sh
kubectl get --help
```

There is also a more detailed [cheatsheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) in the official Kubernetes documentation.

### Inspecting running instances of an application

To list running Pods:

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods
```

To view details for a Pod:

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> describe pod <pod>
```

### Viewing logs

To access the logs of a running container:

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod>
```

### Viewing Kubernetes events

To see Kubernetes events, which can help debugging:

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> get events
```

### Container shell

You can get a shell inside a running container:

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> exec -it <pod> sh
```

### Pod port-forwarding

To forward port 5000 on localhost to port 5001 in the Pod:

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> port-forward <pod> 5000:5001
```
