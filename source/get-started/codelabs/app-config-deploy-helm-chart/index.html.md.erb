## App configuration update in GOVUK helm chart

Update the `HELM_MESSAGE_<seat number from slack>` environment variable value for the test app configuration in [govuk-helm-charts](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/argocd-apps/values-integration.yaml#L998) in a new branch.

## Deploying the changes to the app

Create the pull request on your branch and post it for review on the #govuk-replatforming-codelab channel. After your PR has been approved for merging into the main branch, merge the PR in and look at the [argo CD apps workflow](https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/applications/argocd-apps?view=tree&resource=) as your change gets deployed.

You should ensure the desired manifest in Argo reflects the changes you made (https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/applications/argocd-apps?view=tree&resource=&node=argoproj.io%2FApplication%2Fcluster-services%2Fgovuk-replatform-test-app%2F0)

Navigate to https://govuk-replatform-test-app.eks.integration.govuk.digital/?status=200 to see your HELM_MESSAGE as part of the page output, you have now successfully deployed the change to the GOV.UK kubernetes integration cluster.
