# Debug your app

## Create a shell inside a running container

If you cannot diagnose an issue by looking at the app logs, you can create a shell to run commands inside a running app container.

Run the following in the command line:

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> exec -it <pod> sh -c <container>
```

If you do not specify the container, the command creates a shell inside the first container in the app manifest.

For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation on get a shell to a running container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/get-shell-running-container/).

## Port-forward to a pod

You can make a port available on your local machine to send commands direct to the app from your local machine.

This command works on a pod level rather than a container level, as everything in a pod has the same IP address.

For example, too forward port `5000` on `localhost` to port `5001` in a pod, run:

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> port-forward <pod> 5000:5001
```
You can find the pod port in the app configuration.
