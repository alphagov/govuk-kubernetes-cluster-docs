# Access and view app logs

## Access application logs

You can view application logs using [`kubectl logs`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#logs).

### View logs for an app

```sh
kubectl logs -n apps deploy/<deployment> <container>
```

where:

  - `<deployment>` is the name of the Deployment for the app.
  - `<app>` is the name of the container you want to view logs from.

For example:

```sh
kubectl logs -n apps deploy/publisher-web app
```

### View logs for a specific pod

```sh
kubectl logs -n apps <pod> <container>
```

where:

  - `<pod>` is the name of the Pod you want to view logs from.
  - `<container>` is the name of the container you want to view logs from.

For example:

```
kubectl logs -n apps frontend-7bd8c786d-t5x99 frontend
```

We recommend using [tab completion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#kubectl-autocomplete) to avoid the need to copy-paste pod and container names.

See the [`kubectl` Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#interacting-with-running-pods) for more examples.
